## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Layne â€” passionate about data, analytics, AI for social good. Working at the intersection of strategy, culture, and innovation.

### ðŸ”Ž Exploring what's next in data leadership.
- I recently served as **Deputy Chief Data Officer, Analytics & Infrastructure** at the **U.S. Department of Education**, where I led the **Analytics Division** to drive the strategic use of data in decision-making across grants, loans, and beyond. I currently have a number of projects focused on data community for displaced/fired federal data professionals (for ex. I'll be hosting an Open Space at PyCon May '25).
